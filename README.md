# My Teamtreehouse techdegree project 5

This is my 5th project in the Team Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript techdegree.

In this project we have to make an API request to the randomuser.me API, fetch 12 random employee from it and display them on the page with a search option. Then we have to make a modal window that appears as the user clicks on one of the employees card. The modal window must show first the detailed information of the employee who has been choosen and there is an option to switch back and forth between employees when the detail modal window is open.

The HTML and CSS files are provided by Treehouse, but the JS files are self writen.

Note: I have been altered the CSS styling a little bit:
  - Replaced the font with a new one
  - Added new color
  - Added new background effect
  - Added a little bit of box shadow

At first as i finished this project and gone trough the code, i realized that i can do it in a better way, so i refactored it with object oriented javascript. That was my final version, what i have been submitted for review. You can find the old version of my code in the _script.js file.
